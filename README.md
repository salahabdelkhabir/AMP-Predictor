# AMP Predictor Project

This repository contains the AMP Predictor project, developed during the Fall 2024 semester as part of the Bioinformatics Department’s first-semester project. It focuses on predicting Antimicrobial Peptides (AMPs) using machine learning, including datasets, documentation, and implementation notebooks.
