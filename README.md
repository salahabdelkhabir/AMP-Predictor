# AMP Predictor Project

This repository contains the AMP Predictor project, created as part of the first-semester project for the Bioinformatics Department during the Fall 2024 semester. The project focuses on predicting Antimicrobial Peptides (AMPs) using machine learning techniques. It includes datasets, documentation, and Jupyter notebooks for implementation and analysis.

## Project Structure

The following path tree outlines the project structure:

```
AMP-Predictor/
├── Dataset/
│   ├── AMP.fasta          # FASTA file with AMP sequences
│   └── Non-AMP.fasta      # FASTA file with Non-AMP sequences
│
├── Documentation/
│   ├── Final AMP Book.pdf # Comprehensive project book
│   ├── Preprint.docx      # Draft manuscript summarizing the study
│   ├── Preprint.pdf       # PDF version of the manuscript
│   └── Rollup.pdf         # Concise summary of key findings
│
├── Notebook/
│   └── AMP Predictor.ipynb # Jupyter notebook for analysis and prediction
│
└── README.md              # Project documentation (this file)
```
